#This project was elaborated for the Advanced Programming class
#In this repository, there are C++ codes that are related to the concept of Inheritance.

#In the folder titled "Inheritance across files", there is a main program titled "ThisMain.cpp" and several header (.h) files. The Shape header file includes a class called Shape that has 4 protected attributes, a parameterized constructor, a destructor, two methods, and getters and setters for the attributes.

#The RoundShape and SquareShape header files inherit from the Shape file via the #include "Shape.h" function. Both include classes with 4 unique attributes, but both also inherit the attributes of Shape.h with their values via their parameterized constructor. Each inheriting class also has their own destructor, getters and setters, and methods.

#The HerenciaMultiple code shows an abstract class with only an abstract method. A class called ____ inherits from the abstract method and implements the abstract method.

#4Pilares inlcudes a basic example of inheritance

#Test1 and TEst2 show some applications of the concept of inheritance.
